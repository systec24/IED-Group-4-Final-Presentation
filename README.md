Team Charter
--------------------
HGU Introduction to Engineering Design Team #4

Team Charter

   This charter documents key information regarding a project to be conducted by students at Handong Global University (HGU) enrolled in the HGU Introduction to Engineering Design class. The faculty advisor will be Professor Won Hyeong Lee. The project manager/team leader will be selected at the outset of the project by and from among the members of the student team.
  The team agrees to abide by all restrictions and regulations of Group 4 when on site, to place the safety of the client as its highest priority, and to work in accord with HGU’s Honor Code.

Problem Statement
--------------------
Anxiety caused by communication problems with psychotic patients in the negative pressure room

Principal Functions
--------------------
- The patient and the medical staff should be able to communicate freely
- The patient should be able to have screened meeting

Limits
--------------------
- The size of the room should be at least 10m^2 if the room is from an old building, and 15m^2 is it is a renovated/new building
- The ceiling should be 2.4m high
- The entrance should be at least 1.2m wide
- The air pressure within the room should be at least 2.5Pa
- Only one meeting a day to prevent spread of viruses
- Patients should have psychiatric counseling at least once a week

Pros and Cons
---------------------
1st Design
-----------
Pros: Real-Time conversation between the patients, can communicate face to face reducing the feeling of being lonely, can form bonds for patients are in similar situations.

Cons:Might be difficult to build depending on building structure (Because the rooms have to be right next to each other), may affect the structure that keeps contaminated air inside the room, patients are only limited to talking with other patients.

2nd Design
-----------
Pros: Can have a conversation between patient and counselor, no risk of using materials to enter the room

Cons: Counselor is talking through a doll so the patient may feel uncomfortable, the patient may find it difficult to talk to a doll, the doll is contaminated because it is inside the room


3rd Design
-----------
Pros: No risk of the medical staff entering the room, the patient can hold conversations to feel less lonely, the patient can send an alert to the medical staff whenever they want to have a conversation.

Cons: it may be expensive for many patients may feel the need to have one, medical staff cannot always hold a conversation with the patient

Proof Of Concept (POC)
------------------------
Proof of Concept, or POC, is a method of exercise that focuses on determining whether an idea can be implemented in reality. It is a step by step process that ultimately decides the idea’s viability.

To conduct a POC: 
1. Demonstrate the need for the product

    a. Why does this product need to exist and for who?

2. Ideate the right solution

    a. Which ideas are the best methods to implement?

3. Create a prototype and test it

    a. Does it actually work?

4. Gather and document feedback

    a. Did others approve?
    
    b. What needs to be improved?

5. Present POC for approval

    a. Present to stakeholders
